      <p>My name is Chris Vrellis, and I’m a Digital Artist from Greece (Athens) and As a multidisciplinary Digital Artist, 
        I specialize in various areas of digital media, including (Video Editing, Photo Editing, 2D/3D Animation, Digital Design, 
        Game Development). However, My strongest focus lies in game development, where I bring together art, design, and interactivity 
        to create engaging digital experiences. I’m proficient in using creative software and game engines to turn ideas into playable 
        realities. My experience across different disciplines allows me to work flexibly, adapt quickly, and contribute to multiple 
        stages of the creative process from concept design to final production. As part of my academic and creative journey, 
        I have also conducted in-depth research on Generative AI and its applications in the game development pipeline. 
        Through my thesis project, I explored how tools powered by Gen AI can enhance and accelerate various stages of game creation 
        including concept generation, asset production, and procedural content design. This experience has helped me stay at the forefront 
        of emerging technologies and experiment with AI as a creative collaborator. At last, While my main identity is rooted in digital art, 
        I am personally driven to explore and work with programming as well. I enjoy diving deeper into the technical side of development, 
        constantly learning how code shapes and empowers creative output especially in the context of interactive media and games.

    <h2>VISION & MISSION</h2>
    <div class="vision-content">
    <div class="vision-image"></div>
    <div class="vision-box">
      <p>I’ve always believed in the phrase “Greatness from small beginnings”, and that belief guides me every time 
        I begin or join a new project. Whether it's a small idea or an ambitious concept, I approach each creative 
        process with attention to detail, dedication, and passion. My goal is to give every project the care 
        it deserves, nurturing it from concept to completion with the intent of achieving the best possible result.
        To me, creating digital art isn’t just about visuals, it’s about crafting an experience, telling a story, 
        and building something that resonates. I strive to stay curious, keep learning, and evolve alongside the 
        tools and technologies that shape our creative future. What inspires me most is the power of Digital arts 
        to create entire worlds. The idea that one person or a team can build immersive realities through graphics, 
        code, and creativity continues to amaze me. My goal is to be part of that creative force: to design and develop 
        experiences that inspire, entertain, and connect people through digital art.

    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
    <div class="about-box">
      <img src="pda_uop.png" alt="About Chris">
      <p>The Department of Digital Arts at the University of the Peloponnese is the first university program of its kind in Greece, 
        combining art, technology, and creative experimentation in a unique and modern way. <a href="https://pda.uop.gr/en" target="_blank">(Find it here)</a> 
        I earned my degree in Digital Arts, studying in an environment that encouraged both artistic expression and technical skill development. 
        The curriculum offered me the opportunity to explore a broad range of digital media, including visual storytelling, animation, 
        interacτive design, video editing and game development. During my time at the university, I was exposed to a variety of tools, 
        methods, and creative challenges, which allowed me to discover my passion for crafting interactive experiences and digital worlds. 
        This academic experience not only equipped me with a solid technical foundation, but also taught me how to think critically and adapt 
        creatively across different forms of digital art.
